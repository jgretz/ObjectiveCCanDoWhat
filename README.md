Objective-C can do WHAT?!?!
===========================
MVC can be a great pattern, but all too often in iOS, you end up with 1000+ line controllers that taunt you. When you start to dissect the issue, you discover that so many of those lines are just plumbing, x.foo = bar.

So how do you make it better? In this talk, I'll show you patterns that make your code more SOLID, and black magic that can make the plumbing code "disappear". We'll delve into how introspection, categories, swizzling, and IOC / DI enable us to craft elegant, succinct code. We can put away our hammers (and plungers) and start focusing on the code that brings the idea to life.

Please come join the session that will leave you saying, "Objective-C can do WHAT ?!?!"
